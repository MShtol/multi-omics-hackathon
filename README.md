# Multi-omics data integration

This repository contains materials for **Multi-omics data integration** hackathon for [#NGSprint2021](https://ngschool.eu/ngsprint).

### Running the tutorial materials

To run the tutorial materials locally you need to install Jupyter Notebook, R from CRAN-R and IRKernel which enables the usage of R from the notebooks. 

### Resources & Aknowledgements

A significant portion of included materials was created based on very informative "Multi-omics Analysis" chapter by Jonathan Ronen from the "Computational Genomics with R" book available [here](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/multiomics.html) under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

The Acute Myleoid Leukemia (AML) is availble [here](http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/multi_omic_benchmark/download.html). The data was pre-processed and made available as a part of following paper: *Rappoport, N., & Shamir, R. (2018). Multi-omic and multi-view clustering algorithms: review and cancer benchmark. Nucleic Acids Research, 46(20), 10546â€“10562. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky889*
